<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Kidney Transplantation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a condition where the kidneys fail to function adequately, leading to the accumulation of waste and fluid in the body. The three main types of ESRD treatment include hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Hemodialysis involves removing blood from the body and filtering it externally before returning it, while peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneum lining in the abdomen to filter waste. Kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure where a healthy kidney from a donor is implanted in the patient's body to replace the failed kidney.</p></p>
