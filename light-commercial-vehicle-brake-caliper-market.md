<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Commercial Vehicle Brake Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The light commercial vehicle brake caliper market can be categorized into two types: single piston caliper and multi-piston caliper. A single piston caliper has only one piston that applies force to the brake pads, exerting pressure on the rotor to slow down or stop the vehicle. On the other hand, a multi-piston caliper consists of multiple pistons that distribute the force more evenly across the brake pads, resulting in improved braking performance and reduced wear. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various light commercial vehicles based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
