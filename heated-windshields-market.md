<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heated Windshields Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Wire Windshield</li><li>Heated Coated Windshield</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Heated Windshields market consists of two main types: Heated Wire Windshields and Heated Coated Windshields. Heated Wire Windshields have thin wires embedded in the glass that heat up to quickly defrost and melt ice or snow. This type of windshield is commonly used in colder climates. On the other hand, Heated Coated Windshields have a thin layer of conductive material, such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), applied to the glass surface. This coating heats up when an electrical current is passed through it, providing similar defrosting capabilities.</p></p>
