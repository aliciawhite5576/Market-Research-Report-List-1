<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Bias Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Bias Tires</li><li>Bias Belted Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passenger vehicle bias tire market encompasses two types: ordinary bias tires and bias belted tires. Ordinary bias tires are made with multiple layers of rubber plies, positioned diagonally across one another. They provide durability and excellent load-carrying capacity but have a stiff and less comfortable ride. On the other hand, bias belted tires have additional reinforcing plies known as belts. These belts, positioned under the tread area, improve the tire's stability and handling while maintaining a comfortable ride.</p></p>
