<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ANSI Process Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sealless</li><li>Sealded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ANSI process pumps market comprises two main types: sealless pumps and sealed pumps. Sealless pumps are designed without any seals, which eliminates the risk of leakage and the need for seal maintenance. They use magnetic or canned motor technology to transfer fluids safely and efficiently. Sealed pumps, on the other hand, incorporate seals to prevent fluid leakage, but require regular maintenance and replacement. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries depending on specific requirements for safety, efficiency, and maintenance needs.</p></p>
