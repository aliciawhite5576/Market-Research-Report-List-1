<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Bonded</li><li>Roll Bonded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The composite plate market includes two major types: explosion bonded and roll bonded. Explosion bonded plates are made by placing two different metal layers together and subjecting them to an explosion, creating a strong bond between the layers. Roll bonded plates, on the other hand, are created by passing two metal sheets through a rolling mill, which applies pressure to forge a bond between the layers. Both methods result in composite plates with enhanced properties such as strength, corrosion resistance, and heat resistance, making them useful in various industries.</p></p>
