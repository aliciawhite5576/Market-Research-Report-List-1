<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Ultrasonic Sensor Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type</li><li>Transmission Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile ultrasonic sensor module market consists of two main types: reflective type and transmission type. Reflective type sensors emit ultrasonic waves and measure the distance by detecting the reflection of those waves from objects. They are commonly used for parking assistance and obstacle detection. On the other hand, transmission type sensors send and receive ultrasonic waves separately, allowing for more accurate distance measurement. They are often used in collision avoidance systems. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring automotive safety by detecting obstacles and providing distance information.</p></p>
