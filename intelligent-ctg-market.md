<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent CTG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Cardiotocography</li><li>Internal Cardiotocography</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intelligent CTG refers to advanced technology used in monitoring the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during pregnancy. External Cardiotocography (CTG) involves placing sensors on the mother's abdomen to track the fetal heartbeat and contractions. Internal CTG, on the other hand, requires inserting a sensor directly into the uterus for more precise monitoring. Both types of CTG offer valuable information to healthcare professionals regarding the baby's well-being during labor and delivery, helping to make informed decisions and ensure the best outcomes for both mother and child.</p></p>
