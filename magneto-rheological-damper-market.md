<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magneto-Rheological Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Damper</li><li>Semi Active Damper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Magneto-Rheological Damper Market can be divided into two types: Active Damper and Semi-Active Damper. Active dampers continuously adjust the damping force based on real-time inputs, providing precise control and optimal performance. On the other hand, semi-active dampers have limited adjustability and respond to changing conditions but cannot actively control the damping force. Both types offer improved ride quality and vehicle stability by providing adjustable damping to absorb shocks and vibrations, enhancing the overall driving experience.</p></p>
