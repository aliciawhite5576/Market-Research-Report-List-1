<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Film Plating Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporation Coating Equipment</li><li>Sputter Coating Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Film plating machines are used in various industries for depositing thin films onto different substrates. There are two main types of film plating machines in the market - Evaporation Coating Equipment and Sputter Coating Equipment. Evaporation Coating Equipment uses a heat source to evaporate a solid material which then condenses onto the substrate, forming a thin film. Sputter Coating Equipment, on the other hand, uses plasma discharge to dislodge atoms from a target material, which are then deposited onto the substrate, creating a film. Both methods are widely used in industries like electronics, optics, and automotive.</p></p>
