<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EGFR-TKI for Advanced NSCLC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gefitinib</li><li>Erlotinib</li><li>Afatinib</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>EGFR-TKI (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) is a targeted therapy used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib, Erlotinib, and Afatinib are three types of EGFR-TKIs commonly used in the market. These drugs work by inhibiting the activity of the EGFR protein, which plays a crucial role in promoting cancer cell growth and division. By blocking this protein, EGFR-TKIs can help slow down the progression of advanced NSCLC and improve patient outcomes. These drugs are often prescribed when the cancer has specific EGFR mutations.</p></p>

<p><strong>The EGFR-TKI for Advanced NSCLC Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combination Therapy</li><li>Mono Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>EGFR-TKIs are a type of targeted therapy used for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In combination therapy, EGFR-TKIs are used alongside other drugs to increase treatment effectiveness and improve patient outcomes. Mono therapy refers to the use of EGFR-TKIs as a standalone treatment. Both approaches aim to inhibit the mutated EGFR gene, which is commonly found in NSCLC patients, and help slow down tumor growth. The market for EGFR-TKIs is driven by the increasing prevalence of NSCLC and the need for more effective treatment options.</p></p>
