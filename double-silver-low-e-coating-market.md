<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Silver Low-E Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrolytic low-E Coating</li><li>Sputtered low-E Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Double Silver Low-E Coating market encompasses two distinct types: pyrolytic low-E coating and sputtered low-E coating. Pyrolytic low-E coating involves the application of a thin metallic coating onto glass during the production process using a high-temperature chemical reaction. On the other hand, sputtered low-E coating is applied using a vacuum deposition process, where multiple layers of metals and metal oxides are deposited onto the glass surface. Both types of coatings enhance energy efficiency by reducing heat transfer, but they differ in terms of production method and performance characteristics.</p></p>
