<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Type Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Membrane Type Dryer Market can be categorized into two types: porous and non-porous. Porous membrane dryers utilize a membrane with small pores, allowing water vapor to pass through while blocking larger molecules. These are commonly used for compressed air drying, as they effectively remove moisture. Non-porous membrane dryers, on the other hand, do not have pores and rely on selective permeation to separate moisture from the gas stream. They are typically used for applications where high purity gases are required, such as in the pharmaceutical and food industries.</p></p>
