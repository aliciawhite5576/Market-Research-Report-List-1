<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Bonded Neodymium Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Compression Molding</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The plastic bonded neodymium magnets market consists of two main types: injection molding and compression molding. Injection molding involves feeding a thermoplastic material into a mold cavity, which is then cooled and solidified to create the final product. This process is highly efficient and suitable for complex shapes. Compression molding, on the other hand, uses a pre-heated and pre-formed plastic material that is then placed in a mold and compressed under high pressure until it solidifies. This method is ideal for producing magnets with higher magnetic properties.</p></p>
