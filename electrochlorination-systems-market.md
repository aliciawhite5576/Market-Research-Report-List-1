<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrochlorination Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brine System</li><li>Seawater System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrochlorination Systems involve the production of sodium hypochlorite through the process of electrolysis. The Brine System utilizes a solid salt solution (brine) to generate chlorine, which is then converted into sodium hypochlorite. On the other hand, the Seawater System directly electrochlorinates seawater, eliminating the need for brine production. Both systems find application in industries requiring large-scale disinfection, such as water treatment plants, power generation facilities, and marine industries. Brine Systems are suitable for inland regions with easy access to salt sources, while Seawater Systems are ideal for coastal areas.</p></p>
