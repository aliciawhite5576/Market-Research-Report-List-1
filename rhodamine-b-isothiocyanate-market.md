<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rhodamine B Isothiocyanate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Above 90%</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rhodamine B isothiocyanate is a fluorescent dye commonly used in biological research. In the market, two main types of Rhodamine B isothiocyanate can be distinguished based on their purity levels. The first type is referred to as "above 90%" purity, meaning it contains a high concentration of the dye. This type is preferred by researchers who require accurate and intense fluorescence signals for their experiments. The other type of Rhodamine B isothiocyanate available in the market has a purity level "other" than above 90%, typically around 80%. While it still possesses fluorescence properties, it may have a slightly diminished brightness compared to the higher-purity option. Researchers may opt for this type when cost considerations outweigh the need for maximum fluorescence intensity.</p></p>
