<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cargo Tank Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The cargo tank coating market can be divided into two types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based coatings are made by mixing water with resins and other additives. They offer several benefits such as low VOC emissions, easy application, and quick drying time. On the other hand, solvent-based coatings are made by mixing solvents with resins. These coatings provide excellent resistance against chemicals, abrasion, and corrosion. However, they have high VOC emissions and longer drying time. Both types of coatings are widely used for protecting cargo tanks from damage and improving their longevity.</p></p>
