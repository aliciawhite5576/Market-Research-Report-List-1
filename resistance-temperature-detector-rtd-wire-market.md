<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resistance Temperature Detector RTD Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thin-film RTD</li><li>Wire-wound RTD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) wire market comprises two main types: thin-film RTD and wire-wound RTD. Thin-film RTDs are made by depositing a thin layer of platinum on a ceramic substrate, resulting in a compact design with high accuracy and quick response time. On the other hand, wire-wound RTDs consist of a coil made of a pure platinum wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. They offer higher resistance and greater stability in high-temperature applications. Both types cater to different needs and preferences in the temperature sensing industry.</p></p>
