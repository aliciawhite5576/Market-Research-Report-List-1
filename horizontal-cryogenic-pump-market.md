<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Cryogenic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Non-Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The horizontal cryogenic pump market can be categorized into two types: submersible and non-submersible pumps. Submersible pumps are designed to be placed directly into the cryogenic fluid, allowing for efficient and reliable pumping. These pumps are typically used in applications where the cryogenic fluid needs to be transferred from one location to another. On the other hand, non-submersible pumps are installed outside the cryogenic fluid and are connected to the system through piping. These pumps are commonly used for vaporizing the cryogenic fluid and supplying it to various processes or applications.</p></p>
