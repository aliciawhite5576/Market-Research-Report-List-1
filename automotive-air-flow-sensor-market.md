<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Flow Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vane Meter Type</li><li>Hot Wire Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive airflow sensor market consists of two major types: vane meter type and hot wire type. Vane meter type sensors measure the airflow using a mechanical device known as a vane, which reacts to the incoming airflow. On the other hand, hot wire type sensors use a thin wire heated by an electric current. As the airflow passes over the wire, its temperature changes, and this change is measured to calculate the airflow quantity. Both types play a crucial role in monitoring and controlling the air intake for optimal engine performance in vehicles.</p></p>
