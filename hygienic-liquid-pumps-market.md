<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hygienic Liquid Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Singlestage Pump</li><li>Multistage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hygienic liquid pumps refer to pumps that are used for handling sanitary or hygienic fluids in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology. There are two main types of hygienic liquid pumps: single-stage pumps and multistage pumps. </p><p>Single-stage pumps have a single impeller that rotates within the casing to create pressure and move the liquid. They are generally used for low-pressure applications and can handle a wide range of viscosities.</p><p>Multistage pumps, on the other hand, have multiple impellers arranged in series. This allows them to generate higher pressures, making them suitable for pumping fluids over longer distances or against higher system resistance.</p><p>Both types of pumps are specifically designed to meet the stringent hygiene requirements of industries where contamination must be avoided, ensuring the safety and quality of the processed liquids.</p></p>
