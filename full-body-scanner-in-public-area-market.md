<p><strong>The Full Body Scanner in Public Area Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-Ray Scanner</li><li>Millimeter Wave Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full body scanners are security devices used in public areas to detect concealed objects or substances on individuals. There are two main types of full body scanners: X-ray scanners and millimeter wave scanners. X-ray scanners use low levels of X-ray radiation to generate an image of the person's body, allowing security personnel to identify any hidden objects. On the other hand, millimeter wave scanners use radio waves to create a three-dimensional image of the individual, which can also reveal any concealed items. Both types of scanners provide non-invasive security screening in public areas.</p></p>
