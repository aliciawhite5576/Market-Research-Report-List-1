<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emulsion and Solution SBR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution SBR (s-SBR)</li><li>Emulsion SBR (e-SBR)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solution SBR (s-SBR) and Emulsion SBR (e-SBR) are two types of SBR (Styrene-butadiene Rubber) used in various industries. s-SBR is produced through a polymerization process resulting in a solution of SBR polymer, which possesses high elasticity, tear strength, and abrasion resistance. On the other hand, e-SBR is produced through emulsion polymerization, where the SBR polymer is suspended in water, making it easily dispersible and easy to handle. Both types of SBR offer unique advantages and are commonly used in tire manufacturing, adhesives, and footwear industries.</p></p>
