<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sealing Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Sealing Coatings</li><li>Dry Sealing Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sealing coatings are used to protect surfaces from damage and ensure longevity. Liquid sealing coatings are applied as a liquid and then dry to form a protective layer. They are suitable for various porous surfaces and provide a flexible and transparent barrier. Dry sealing coatings, on the other hand, are applied directly in powder form and do not require any mixing or solvents. They provide a durable and hard protective layer and are commonly used on metals, plastics, and concrete surfaces. Both types offer different advantages, catering to specific application requirements.</p></p>
