<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mareks Vaccine for Poultry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Attenuated Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Marek's vaccine for poultry market consists of three main types of vaccines: live vaccines, attenuated vaccines, and killed vaccines. </p><p>Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the Marek's virus, which stimulate the birds' immune system to produce a protective response without causing disease. Attenuated vaccines are made from closely related viruses that have been modified to lose their pathogenicity while still stimulating immunity. Killed vaccines are made from inactivated Marek's virus particles, which cannot cause disease but can still induce an immune response. These different forms of vaccines provide options for poultry producers to protect their flocks against Marek's disease.</p></p>
