<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Pre-Crash Seatbelt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preload Type Belt</li><li>Preroll Preload Type Belt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive pre-crash seatbelt market includes two main types: preload type belts and preroll preload type belts. Preload type belts work by tightening the seatbelt a split second prior to a collision, pulling occupants firmly against their seats to reduce injury. On the other hand, preroll preload type belts have an additional feature that rolls up the seatbelt to take up any slack before an impact occurs, providing even greater protection. Both types aim to enhance passenger safety by ensuring a secure and snug fit during a crash.</p></p>
