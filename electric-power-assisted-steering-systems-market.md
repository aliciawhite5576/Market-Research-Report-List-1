<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Power Assisted Steering Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>C-EPAS</li><li>P-EPAS</li><li>R-EPAS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electric Power Assisted Steering Systems (EPAS) can be categorized into three types: Column-assist EPAS (C-EPAS), Pinion-assist EPAS (P-EPAS), and Rack-assist EPAS (R-EPAS). C-EPAS is a system where the assist motor is integrated into the steering column, providing assistance through a mechanical connection. P-EPAS, on the other hand, has the assist motor located in the steering pinion, providing assistance directly to the steering gear mechanism. Lastly, R-EPAS has the assist motor located on the steering rack, providing assistance by directly affecting the rack motion. These different types cater to various vehicle requirements and steering mechanisms.</p></p>
