<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Flow Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Type</li><li>Digital Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive air flow meter market comprises two main types: analog and digital. Analog type air flow meters use traditional gauges or needle displays to provide readings of the air flow rate in a vehicle's engine, allowing technicians to manually interpret the data. Digital type air flow meters, on the other hand, utilize electronic displays and sensors to automatically measure and display air flow rate, providing more accurate and precise readings. Both types serve the purpose of measuring air flow in vehicles, but digital meters offer advanced features and ease of use compared to analog meters.</p></p>
