<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wool-protective Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionic</li><li>Nonionic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ionic and nonionic are two types of wool-protective agents that serve different purposes in the market. Ionic agents are compounds that contain charged particles, either positive or negative, which interact with the wool fibers. They can enhance the durability and strength of wool, making it more resistant to damage. Nonionic agents, on the other hand, do not have any charged particles and work by forming a protective layer on the wool fibers. This layer helps repel water and prevent staining, maintaining the quality and appearance of the wool over time.</p></p>
