<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scratch Resistant Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-tempered Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li><li>Super Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The scratch-resistant glass market primarily consists of three types: semi-tempered glass, tempered glass, and super tempered glass. Semi-tempered glass is a form of toughened glass that is slightly stronger than regular glass but offers limited scratch resistance. Tempered glass is processed under high temperatures to enhance strength and scratch resistance, making it more durable than semi-tempered glass. Super tempered glass, the strongest of the three, undergoes additional heating and cooling processes, providing exceptional scratch resistance and strength. All three types offer varying levels of scratch protection for different applications in the glass industry.</p></p>
