<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Supercharger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Twin-Screw</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Supercharger market consists of two main types: Centrifugal and Twin-Screw. Centrifugal superchargers use a belt-driven impeller to draw in, compress, and then discharge air into the engine intake. These are efficient, compact, and provide a linear power delivery. On the other hand, Twin-Screw superchargers use two meshing screws to compress air and deliver it to the engine. They offer excellent low-end torque, smooth power delivery, and are relatively quiet. Both types increase engine power and performance, but the choice depends on specific requirements and preferences.</p></p>
