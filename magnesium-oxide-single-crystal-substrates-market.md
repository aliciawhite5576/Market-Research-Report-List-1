<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Oxide Single Crystal Substrates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side Polishing</li><li>Both Side Polishing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Magnesium Oxide Single Crystal Substrates market can be divided into two types based on the polishing process: Single Side Polishing and Both Side Polishing. In Single Side Polishing, only one side of the substrate is polished, resulting in a smooth and flat surface on one side while the other side remains unpolished. Both Side Polishing, on the other hand, involves polishing both sides of the substrate, creating smooth and flat surfaces on both sides. These polishing techniques provide different options for manufacturers based on their requirements and applications.</p></p>
